# Paper Notes

Each heading is a date, displayed in YYMM format.

Each bulletpoint is a paper, with a link to the summary written in markdown. Each bulletpoint has an indented point with some "tags" for easy searching with ctrl+f. All tags use hyphens instead of spaces. Order of tags is irrelevant.
